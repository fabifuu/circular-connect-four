# Circular Connect Four

Welcome to **Circular Connect Four**! The goal of the game is to create a four-in-a-row pattern, but with a unique twist: the board is circular, not rectangular! This game is an extension of the classic *m,n,k-game*, where the objective is to align m pieces in a row on an m × n rectangular board. Think of games like tic-tac-toe or gomoku. In this version, we have a **circular 8 × 4 board**, making it continuous and connected.

## Pieces and Gameplay
Unlike traditional games that use Xs and Os (tic-tac-toe) or black and white stones (gomoku), **Circular Connect Four** uses **red** and **blue** color. The **red player** begins by coloring the grid or *segment* of the board, followed by the **blue player**, taking turns alternately.

The condition for winning is to achieve **four-in-a-row** in any of the following ways:
1. **Vertical (Radial)** – Colors are aligned in a straight column (also called as "radial" manner).
2. **Circular (Concentric)** – Colors are aligned along the circular or concentric rings of the board.
3. **Diagonal (Spiral)** – Colors are aligned diagonally, forming a spiral pattern across the board.
